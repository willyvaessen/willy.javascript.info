# JavaScript.info - The Modern JavaScript Tutorial

## Intro

While browsing the [Discord website](https://discord.com/) I came 
across [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) with a seemingly complete 
tutorial on JavaScript, which I started reading.

Since I decided to dive deep into JavaScript and actually really develop
in-depth knowledge, I figured it would be a good idea to work my way through 
this huge tutorial, starting with the [Fundamentals](https://javascript.info/first-steps).

This repository will contain the files that I create(d) along the way.


## 01. Hello World

This first chapter starts off rather easily with an explanation of how 
JavaScript can be inserted into a website. 
In the folder [01.Hello_World](01.Hello_World) 
you can find my take on the tasks presented in this chapter.


## 02. Code structure

No real assignment in this chapter, just some information on code structure.


## 03. The modern mode, "use strict"

It's actually the first time I lear about "use strict" to be honest. 
I can't remember hearing about it in the frontend lessons I had.
I checked the learning materials and was unable to find it at this point.
No assignment in this chapter.


## 04. Variables

I got some useful information about variables. How to declare them, when to use
which one.


## 05. Data types

There are eight basic data types in JavaScript that are discussed in this chapter.
