<h1>Basic operators, math</h1>
<p>Back in the day, when I went to school, I learned about a lot of operators in math. They can also be used in JavaScript to perform operations on values (operands)</p>
<p>This chapter covers these operators and concentrates on the JavaScript specific aspects that we did not learn in school.</p>

<h2>Maths</h2>
<p class="article intro">The following maths operators are supported in JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Addition +</li>
    <li>Subtraction -</li>
    <li>Multiplication *</li>
    <li>Division /</li>
    <li>Remainder %</li>
    <li>Exponentiation **</li>
</ul>
<p class="article">The first four are very straightforward, which is less the case for the Remainder (%) and Exponentiation (**)</p>

<h2>Remainder (%)</h2>
<p class="article intro">Although there is a % sign in this operator, it has nothing to do with percents. It is used to find the remainder of a division between two integers.</p>
<p class="article">The result of a % b is what remains after dividing a by b.</p>

<h2>Exponentiation (**)</h2>
<p class="article intro">The exponentiation operator in 'a ** b' is used to raise a to the power of b</p>
<p class="article">Example: 2 ** 4 = 2*2*2*2 = 16</p>


<h2>Task</h2>
<p>No tasks in this chapter to write code on.</p>
