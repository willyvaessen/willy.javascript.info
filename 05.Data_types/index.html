<h1>Data types</h1>
<p>JavaScript has different data types we can work with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Number</li>
    <li>BigInt</li>
    <li>String</li>
    <li>Boolean</li>
    <li>null</li>
    <li>undefined</li>
    <li>Objects</li>
    <li>Symbols</li>
</ul>


<h2>Number</h2>
<p class="article intro">Represents both integers and floating point numbers.</p>
<p class="article">There are also "special numeric values" like Infinity, -Infinity an NaN
  (Not a Number).</p>

<h2>BigInt</h2>
<p class="article intro">Is used for really, really big numbers, that do not fit into the fixed 64-bit storage.</p>
<p class="article">Is created by appending an 'n' to the number.</p>


<h2>String</h2>
<p class="article intro">A string is mostly used for text related things. Strings must be surrounded by quotes.</p>
<p class="article"><p>There are single quotes ('') as well as double quotes ("") which are "simple" quotes.</p>
<p>There's also the backtics (``) which has some extended functionality, like allowing variables and expressions to be embedded in the string.</p>

<h2>Boolean (logical type)</h2>
<p class="article intro">The Boolean data type has only two values: true and false.</p>
<p class="article"><p>...</p>

<h2>null</h2>
<p class="article intro">Is a special data type that does not belong to any of the data types mentioned above.</p>
<p class="article"><p>Unlike other languages, in JavaScript "null" is not a reference to something that does not exist. It is defined to be nothing or unknown at the moment of declaring.</p>

<h2>undefined</h2>
<p class="article intro">Another special data type, which tells us that the value of a variable is not (yet) defined.</p>
<p class="article"><p>This is the case when a variable has been declared, but no value is assigned to it.</p>

<h2>Objects and Symbols</h2>
<p class="article intro">Objects are a way to store multiple values in a single variable, thus making it a special data type and non-primitive, unlike the previous data types.</p>
<p class="article"><p>Symbol type is used to "create unique identifiers for objects" and other than that, I haven't heard of these before so not much to tell at this point.</p>

<h2>typeof</h2>
<p class="article intro">An operator that returns the data type an operand.</p>
<p class="article"><p>...</p>
