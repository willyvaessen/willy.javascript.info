<h1>Interactions</h1>
<p>JavaScript has different functions to interact with the user through the browser, which are discussed in this chapter.</p>



<h2>alert</h2>
<p class="article intro">The alert function sends a pop up with a message, that waits for the user to click "OK"</p>
<p class="article">More article text (if needed)</p>

<h2>prompt</h2>
<p class="article intro">The prompt is a modal window, just like the alert, but it accepts two arguments.</p>
<p class="article">The modal window asks the user for some input, which can be typed.</p>

<h2>confirm</h2>
<p class="article intro">The confirm function allows us to ask the user a question through a modal window, accepting OK or Cancel for an answer.</p>
<p class="article">Pressing OK will make the result true and pressing Cancel will make it false.</p>

<h2>Tasl for this chapter</h2>
<p>The task assigned in this chapter is to prompt the user to enter their name and output it.</p>
<script>
    let userName=prompt("Please enter your name", "");
    alert(`Your name is ${userName}`);
</script>

<h2>subtitle header</h2>
<p class="article intro">Intro to an article</p>
<p class="article">More article text (if needed)</p>
<p>You will (or have seen) some alerts from the JavaScript in this page.</p>
